## About
Game Engine is an early-stage rendering engine for Windows.
The goal of Game Engine is to learn the processes involved in creating a game engine and environment.

### Materials Used
Game Engine is written by me, Kerra McLeod, starting in August 2023, made studying from the works of Jason Gregorys "Game Engine Architecture", Yan Chernikov (The Cherno) "Game Engine", and others in the game development community.

## Get Started
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended. 
Game Engine is untested on development environments other than Windows builds.
